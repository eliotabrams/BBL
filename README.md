An implementation of the BBL (2007) procedure in Python


1) scrapelocations.py builds the dataset by scrapping Chicago Food Truck Finder's website (DON'T RERUN)

2) BBL.py is a script containing the variables and functions used to run the BBL procedure

3) createdata.py builds the datasets used in the simulation

4) simulate.py runs the simulation (is currently written to be manually run in parallel on the Booth Research Grid)

5) estimate.py estimates the parameters from the value functions produced by simulate.py
